# Story 2.4: Ability Score System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** D&D player,  
**I want** a clear and intuitive ability score system,  
**so that** I can understand my character's strengths and weaknesses

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) are clearly displayed
2. Modifiers are automatically calculated and displayed
3. Multiple generation methods are supported (point buy, standard array, rolling)
4. Point buy system enforces D&D 5e rules and constraints
5. Ability score validation prevents invalid combinations
6. Visual indicators show above/below average scores
7. Ability score changes update all dependent calculations
8. System supports racial ability score bonuses and penalties

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design ability score data model and UI (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [ ] Create ability score component with clear display
  - [ ] Implement modifier calculation and display
  - [ ] Add visual indicators for score ranges
  - [ ] Create responsive layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement ability score generation methods (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create point buy system with D&D 5e rules
  - [ ] Implement standard array option
  - [ ] Add dice rolling simulation
  - [ ] Implement generation method selection
- [ ] Build validation and calculation system (AC: 5, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create ability score validation rules
  - [ ] Implement racial bonus/penalty system
  - [ ] Add dependent calculation updates
  - [ ] Create validation error messages

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Ability score system integrates with character creation wizard
- Racial bonuses and penalties must be applied correctly
- Modifiers affect many other character calculations
- Point buy system has specific D&D 5e constraints

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for calculations, integration tests for validation
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Modifier calculations, validation rules, racial bonuses

**Architecture Notes:**
- Ability score system must be ruleset-agnostic for future game systems
- Calculations should be real-time and responsive
- Validation should prevent invalid character states
- Performance should support quick updates during character creation
