# Story 3.4: AI Tool Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** D&D player,  
**I want** the AI to directly access validation and balance checking tools,  
**so that** I get accurate, actionable advice about my character

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI can call validation tools to check character legality
2. AI can access balance checking tools for power analysis
3. AI can perform rule lookups and provide citations
4. Tool integration works seamlessly with chat interface
5. AI responses include tool results and recommendations
6. Tool calls are logged for debugging and improvement
7. Fallback mechanisms work when tools are unavailable
8. Tool integration maintains AI response quality

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design tool integration architecture (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Define tool interface for AI consumption
  - [ ] Create tool result formatting system
  - [ ] Implement tool availability checking
  - [ ] Add tool versioning and compatibility
- [ ] Implement tool calling system (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create tool execution service
  - [ ] Implement tool result processing
  - [ ] Add tool call logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Create tool result caching
- [ ] Build fallback and error handling (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] Implement graceful tool degradation
  - [ ] Add error handling for tool failures
  - [ ] Create fallback response generation
  - [ ] Add tool health monitoring

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Tool integration connects AI with validation and balance systems
- Tools must be accessible and performant for AI use
- Fallback mechanisms ensure AI remains helpful
- Tool results must be formatted for clear user understanding

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for tool integration, integration tests for AI responses
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Tool availability, fallback mechanisms, response quality

**Architecture Notes:**
- Tool integration should be asynchronous and non-blocking
- Tool results should be cached to improve performance
- Error handling should maintain AI response quality
- Tool availability should be monitored and reported
