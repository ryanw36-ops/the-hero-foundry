# Story 1.1: Application Shell Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a working Tauri + React application shell,  
**so that** I can begin building the core features of The Hero Foundry

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tauri desktop application launches successfully on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. React + TypeScript frontend renders with Material-UI components
3. Basic navigation structure is in place
4. Development environment supports hot reloading and debugging
5. Application can be built and packaged for distribution

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Tauri project with React + TypeScript template (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Set up Tauri CLI and development environment
  - [ ] Configure React + TypeScript with Vite
  - [ ] Install and configure Material-UI components
- [ ] Create basic application structure (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Set up main App component with routing
  - [ ] Implement basic navigation layout
  - [ ] Add placeholder pages for main sections
- [ ] Configure build and development tools (AC: 4, 5)
