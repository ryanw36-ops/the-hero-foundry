# Story 6.5: Performance Testing Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,  
**I want** comprehensive performance testing that validates cross-platform performance targets,  
**so that** we can ensure the application meets user experience requirements on all platforms

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Performance benchmarks are established for all critical operations
2. Cross-platform performance testing covers Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. Performance tests measure response times, memory usage, and CPU utilization
4. Automated performance regression testing prevents performance degradation
5. Performance metrics are tracked and reported over time
6. Performance tests run in CI/CD pipeline with failure thresholds
7. Performance optimization recommendations are generated from test results

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks for critical operations (AC: 1)
- [ ] Set up performance testing framework and tools (AC: 2, 3)
- [ ] Implement cross-platform performance testing infrastructure (AC: 2)
- [ ] Create performance tests for all critical user workflows (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement memory usage and CPU utilization monitoring (AC: 3)
- [ ] Set up automated performance regression testing (AC: 4)
- [ ] Configure performance metrics collection and reporting (AC: 5)
- [ ] Integrate performance tests into CI/CD pipeline (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement performance failure thresholds and alerts (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create performance optimization analysis tools (AC: 7)
- [ ] Develop performance testing documentation and guidelines (AC: 7)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring for production environments (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Essential for user experience and platform compatibility
- **Current State:** Limited performance testing
- **Target State:** Comprehensive performance validation across all platforms
- **Performance Metrics:** Response time, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **Platform Coverage:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated performance regression testing

## Testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met on all platforms
- [ ] Performance tests run consistently in CI/CD
- [ ] Performance regression detection works correctly
- [ ] Performance metrics are accurately collected and reported
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations are actionable
- [ ] No false performance failures
