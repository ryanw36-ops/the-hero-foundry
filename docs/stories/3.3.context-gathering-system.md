# Story 3.3: Context Gathering System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** D&D player,  
**I want** the AI to understand my current character build context,  
**so that** I get relevant and personalized assistance

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System automatically gathers current character build state
2. Context includes visible UI step and user selections
3. Character data is formatted for AI consumption
4. Context is updated in real-time as user makes changes
5. AI responses reference specific character details
6. Context includes ruleset and validation information
7. System maintains conversation context across multiple interactions
8. Context gathering has minimal performance impact

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design context data model (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Define context structure for character builds
  - [ ] Create context serialization for AI consumption
  - [ ] Implement context versioning and change tracking
  - [ ] Add context metadata and timestamps
- [ ] Implement real-time context gathering (AC: 2, 4, 6)
  - [ ] Create context monitoring service
  - [ ] Implement UI step detection
  - [ ] Add character data change tracking
  - [ ] Integrate with ruleset validation system
- [ ] Build context management system (AC: 5, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create context storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Implement conversation context persistence
  - [ ] Add context optimization for performance
  - [ ] Create context cleanup and management

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Context system integrates with character creation wizard
- AI assistant uses context for personalized responses
- Performance is critical for real-time context updates
- Context must include all relevant character information

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for context logic, integration tests for AI integration
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Context accuracy, performance testing, AI integration

**Architecture Notes:**
- Context system must be efficient and non-blocking
- Context data should be structured for easy AI consumption
- Real-time updates should not impact user experience
- Context should support complex character builds and multiclass
