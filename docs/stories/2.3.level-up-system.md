# Story 2.3: Level-Up System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** D&D player,  
**I want** a guided level-up system with automatic change detection,  
**so that** I can progress my character quickly and accurately

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System detects when character is eligible for level-up
2. Level-up process guides user through available choices step-by-step
3. System shows exactly what choices need to be made
4. AI assistant explains implications of each choice during level-up
5. System validates selections against D&D rules
6. Level-up can be completed in under 2 minutes
7. Snapshot of previous level is automatically saved
8. Character progression follows D&D 5e rules exactly

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement level-up eligibility detection (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create experience point tracking system
  - [ ] Add level-up trigger detection
  - [ ] Implement multiclass level-up handling
- [ ] Build level-up wizard interface (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create level-up step components
  - [ ] Implement choice selection interface
  - [ ] Add progress tracking for level-up process
- [ ] Integrate AI assistance for level-up guidance (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Connect AI assistant to level-up context
  - [ ] Implement choice explanation system
  - [ ] Add recommendation engine for level-up choices
- [ ] Implement level-up validation and completion (AC: 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create rule validation for level-up choices
  - [ ] Implement automatic snapshot creation
  - [ ] Add level-up completion tracking
  - [ ] Integrate with character progression system

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Level-up system integrates with character creation wizard
- AI assistant provides context-aware guidance during progression
- Character snapshots are created at each level for version tracking
- Multiclass progression must be handled correctly

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for level-up logic, integration tests for progression
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Level-up validation, snapshot creation, performance testing

**Architecture Notes:**
- Level-up system must integrate with ruleset validation
- Performance target: < 2 minutes for complete level-up process
- Snapshot system preserves character history for audit purposes
- AI integration provides intelligent guidance for complex choices
