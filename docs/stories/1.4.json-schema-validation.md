# Story 1.4: JSON Schema Validation Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a robust JSON schema validation framework,  
**so that** all content follows proper data structures and prevents errors

## Acceptance Criteria
1. JSON schema validation framework validates all content types
2. Schema files are loaded from ruleset directories automatically
3. Validation errors provide clear, actionable feedback to users
4. Schema validation works for rulesets, characters, and homebrew content
5. Performance impact of validation is minimal (< 100ms per validation)
6. Schema caching improves subsequent validation performance
7. Validation can be run in real-time during content creation
8. Schema versioning and migration support is implemented

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design JSON schema structure for all content types (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Define schema for ruleset manifests
  - [ ] Create character data schemas
  - [ ] Design homebrew content schemas
  - [ ] Implement schema versioning system
- [ ] Implement validation engine (AC: 3, 5, 7)
  - [ ] Create validation service with error reporting
  - [ ] Implement real-time validation during content creation
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - [ ] Create validation result formatting
- [ ] Build schema management system (AC: 2, 6, 8)
  - [ ] Implement automatic schema loading from rulesets
  - [ ] Add schema caching for performance
  - [ ] Create schema version detection and migration
  - [ ] Add schema validation for schema files themselves

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- JSON schema validation must integrate with ruleset system
- All content types require schema definitions
- Performance is critical for real-time validation
- Schema versioning supports future compatibility

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for validation logic, performance tests for timing
- Testing frameworks: Jest for frontend, pytest for backend
- Specific testing requirements: Schema validation accuracy, performance benchmarks, error handling

**Architecture Notes:**
- Validation framework must be extensible for new content types
- Real-time validation should not block user interactions
- Schema caching should improve performance for repeated validations
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
