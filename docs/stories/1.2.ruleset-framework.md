# Story 1.2: Modular Ruleset Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a modular ruleset framework with hot-loadable support,  
**so that** the system can support different game systems beyond D&D 5e

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App scans `/rulesets/*/ruleset.json` at startup and loads available rulesets
2. Each ruleset contains self-contained schemas, engines, content, and templates
3. User can switch active ruleset without restarting the application
4. Priority system resolves conflicts: core < third-party < homebrew
5. Ruleset validation ensures schema compliance and content integrity
6. Ruleset switching preserves user data and character compatibility
7. System gracefully handles invalid or corrupted ruleset files

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design ruleset directory structure and manifest format (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Define ruleset.json schema with required fields
  - [ ] Create directory structure for ruleset content
  - [ ] Design priority system for content resolution
- [ ] Implement ruleset scanning and loading system (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Create ruleset discovery service
  - [ ] Implement JSON schema validation for ruleset manifests
  - [ ] Add error handling for invalid rulesets
- [ ] Build ruleset switching mechanism (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Implement active ruleset state management
  - [ ] Create ruleset switching UI component
  - [ ] Handle data migration between compatible rulesets
- [ ] Implement content priority and conflict resolution (AC: 4, 7)
  - [ ] Create content loading priority system
  - [ ] Implement conflict detection and resolution
  - [ ] Add validation for content compatibility

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Rulesets stored in `/rulesets/` directory with JSON manifest files
- Each ruleset must be self-contained with schemas, engines, content, and templates
- Priority system: core < third-party < homebrew for conflict resolution
- File-driven architecture with no database dependencies

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for ruleset loading, integration tests for switching
- Testing frameworks: Jest for frontend, pytest for backend
- Specific testing requirements: Ruleset validation, conflict resolution, switching scenarios

**Architecture Notes:**
- Ruleset system must support hot-loading without application restart
- Content validation using JSON Schema for all ruleset components
- Modular design allowing easy addition of new game systems
- Graceful degradation when ruleset files are corrupted or invalid
