# Story 4.2: Balance System & Power Budget Analysis

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** homebrew creator,  
**I want** balance validation and power budget analysis,  
**so that** my content doesn't break game balance

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Balance heuristics with suggested nerfs for overpowered content
2. Power budget analysis for racial traits, class features, and spells
3. Two modes: Balanced (strict enforcement) and Free-for-All (anything goes)
4. Balanced Mode blocks invalid characters and homebrew
5. Free-for-All allows anything but flags output permanently
6. Drawback system provides refunds for character weaknesses
7. Content validation prevents rule-breaking combinations
8. Balance checking works for both core and homebrew content

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement balance validation engine (AC: 1, 2, 8)
  - [ ] Create power budget calculation system
  - [ ] Implement racial trait cost analysis
  - [ ] Build class feature power curve validation
  - [ ] Add spell access and power level checking
- [ ] Build balance mode system (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create mode selection interface
  - [ ] Implement Balanced Mode enforcement
  - [ ] Add Free-for-All mode with permanent flagging
  - [ ] Create mode switching validation
- [ ] Implement drawback and refund system (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create character weakness detection
  - [ ] Implement power budget refunds
  - [ ] Add balance adjustment recommendations
- [ ] Integrate with content validation (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Connect balance system to homebrew editor
  - [ ] Implement real-time balance checking
  - [ ] Add balance feedback to content creation

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Balance system integrates with ruleset validation and homebrew editor
- Power budget analysis uses point-based system for racial traits
- Class feature curves validate per-level power progression
- Spell access caps enforce hard limits on spell progression

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for balance calculations, integration tests for validation
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Power budget validation, mode switching, balance accuracy

**Architecture Notes:**
- Balance system must work with all content types (races, classes, items, spells)
- Power budget calculations should be configurable per ruleset
- Real-time balance checking should not impact performance
- Integration with AI assistant for balance recommendations
