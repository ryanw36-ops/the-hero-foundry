# Story 4.3: Content Type Templates

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** homebrew creator,  
**I want** pre-built templates for different content types,  
**so that** I can quickly start creating custom content

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Templates exist for races, classes, items, and spells
2. Templates include common fields and validation rules
3. Users can start from scratch or use template as starting point
4. Templates are ruleset-specific and follow D&D 5e patterns
5. Template fields include helpful placeholder text and examples
6. Templates can be customized and saved as personal templates
7. System validates template-generated content against schemas
8. Templates support both simple and complex content types

  - [ ] Create template data model for all content types
  - [ ] Define template field structure and validation

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Templates integrate with homebrew editor and validation system
- Templates must follow D&D 5e design patterns
- System should support both beginner and advanced creators
- Templates must be extensible for future content types

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for template logic, integration tests for editor
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Template validation, customization, integration

**Architecture Notes:**
