# Story 3.1: AI Chat Panel

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** new D&D player,  
**I want** an always-visible AI chat panel,  
**so that** I can get help and guidance throughout character creation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Always-visible chat panel on right side of the interface
2. AI explains rules, recommends choices, and validates builds
3. Context includes current build state and visible UI step
4. Chat panel maintains conversation history during session
5. AI responses are clear, accurate, and helpful
6. Panel integrates seamlessly with character creation workflow
7. Chat interface is intuitive and easy to use

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design and implement chat panel UI (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Create chat panel component with proper positioning
  - [ ] Implement chat message display and input interface
  - [ ] Add conversation history and scrolling functionality
- [ ] Integrate AI service with chat interface (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Connect ChatGPT API to chat system
  - [ ] Implement message formatting and display
  - [ ] Add error handling for AI service failures
- [ ] Implement context-aware assistance (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create context gathering system for current build state
  - [ ] Integrate with character creation wizard steps
  - [ ] Add context injection into AI prompts
- [ ] Build chat session management (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement conversation persistence during session
  - [ ] Add chat history management
  - [ ] Create session cleanup and reset functionality

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- AI integration uses ChatGPT API with structured tool calling
- Chat panel must integrate with character creation wizard context
- Context includes current build state and visible UI step
- Fallback mechanisms required when AI is unavailable

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for chat interface, integration tests for AI service
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: AI integration, context awareness, error handling

**Architecture Notes:**
- Chat panel must be non-intrusive to character creation workflow
- AI responses should be cached to improve performance
- Context system must gather relevant information without performance impact
- Integration with validation and balance checking tools
