## Story Template
All stories follow the standard story template format with:
- **Status:** Current development status
- **Story:** User story in "As a... I want... so that..." format
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Numbered list of completion criteria
- **Tasks/Subtasks:** Breakdown of implementation work
- **Dev Notes:** Technical context and architecture information
- **Change Log:** Version history and modifications
- **Dev Agent Record:** Development implementation details
- **QA Results:** Quality assurance validation

## Development Workflow
1. **Story Planning:** Stories are created and refined during sprint planning
2. **Development:** Stories move from Draft → InProgress → Review → Done
3. **Validation:** Each story must meet all acceptance criteria
4. **Integration:** Completed stories integrate into the overall system
5. **Testing:** Stories are validated through automated and manual testing

## Dependencies & Critical Path
- **Epic 1** must complete on schedule to avoid cascading delays
- **Epic 2** is the foundation for all subsequent features
- **Epics 3 & 4** can be developed in parallel after Epic 2 completion
- **Epic 5** can begin development while Epics 3 & 4 are in progress

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** AI integration complexity may require additional time
- **Medium Risk:** Balance system heuristics require extensive testing
- **Low Risk:** Basic character creation and export functionality

## Success Metrics
- **Development:** Sprint velocity consistently at 7 points per week
- **Quality:** Zero critical bugs, 90%+ test coverage
- **User Experience:** Character creation < 5 minutes, level-up < 2 minutes
- **Performance:** App startup < 3 seconds, UI responsiveness < 2 seconds
