# Story 6.2: Tauri File System Integration Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** the application to actually save and load files from my local file system,  
**so that** my character data is truly local-first and persists between sessions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Character data is saved to actual local file system via Tauri APIs
2. File operations use proper Tauri file system permissions and security
3. Support for multiple file formats (JSON, PDF, PNG) with real file system
4. File browser integration for save/load operations
5. Proper error handling for file system operations
6. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Research Tauri file system APIs and best practices (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Implement file system permission handling (AC: 2)
- [ ] Replace simulated file operations with real Tauri APIs (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement file save operations with user-selected locations (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Implement file load operations with file browser integration (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Add file format validation and conversion (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for file system failures (AC: 5)
- [ ] Test file operations across all supported platforms (AC: 6)
- [ ] Update file storage service to use real file system (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add file system operation logging and debugging (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Core functionality for local-first architecture
- **Current State:** Using simulated file operations
- **Target State:** Real file system integration via Tauri
- **Security Considerations:** Proper permission handling required
- **Platform Differences:** File system APIs may vary between OS
- **User Experience:** File browser integration for intuitive file management

## Testing
- [ ] Files are actually saved to local file system
- [ ] Files can be loaded from any location user selects
- [ ] File operations work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Proper error messages for file system failures
- [ ] File permissions are handled correctly
- [ ] No data loss during file operations

## Change Log
- **Created:** 2025-01-27 - Critical file system integration needed for local-first architecture
