# Story 6.4: Integration Tests Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,  
**I want** comprehensive integration tests that validate component interactions and data schemas,  
**so that** we can ensure the application works correctly as a cohesive system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration tests validate component communication and data flow
2. Schema validation tests ensure data integrity across the system
3. API integration tests verify backend communication
4. State management tests validate data flow between components
5. Cross-component interaction tests verify system integration
6. Test data is realistic and covers edge cases
7. Integration tests run as part of the automated test suite

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up integration testing framework and infrastructure (AC: 1, 7)
- [ ] Create test utilities for component integration testing (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement schema validation tests for all data models (AC: 2)
- [ ] Create API integration tests for all endpoints (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement state management integration tests (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create cross-component interaction tests (AC: 5)
- [ ] Develop realistic test data factories and fixtures (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement error handling and edge case testing (AC: 6)
- [ ] Add performance testing for integration scenarios (AC: 1)
- [ ] Configure integration tests in CI/CD pipeline (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create integration testing documentation and guidelines (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Essential for system reliability
- **Current State:** Limited integration testing
- **Target State:** Comprehensive integration test coverage
- **Testing Focus:** Component interactions, data flow, schema validation
- **Test Data:** Realistic scenarios and edge cases
- **Performance:** Integration tests should not significantly slow down CI/CD

## Testing
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Component interactions work correctly
- [ ] Data schemas are properly validated
- [ ] API integrations function as expected
- [ ] State management flows correctly
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are handled
- [ ] Integration tests complete within reasonable time
