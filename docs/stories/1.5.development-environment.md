# Story 1.5: Development Environment Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a fully configured development environment,  
**so that** I can efficiently develop and debug The Hero Foundry application

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Development environment supports hot reloading and debugging
2. TypeScript compilation and linting are properly configured
3. Testing frameworks are set up and working
4. Build process works for all target platforms
5. Development tools provide helpful error messages and debugging info
6. Environment variables and configuration are properly managed
7. Code formatting and quality tools are integrated
8. Development server starts in under 10 seconds

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Project uses Tauri + React + TypeScript stack
- Target platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Development tools must support desktop application development
- Performance is critical for development efficiency

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests, integration tests, build verification
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Build process validation, cross-platform compatibility

**Architecture Notes:**
- Development environment must support both frontend and backend development
- Hot reloading should work for React components and Tauri backend
- Build process must generate platform-specific executables
- Development tools should provide clear feedback for debugging
