# Story 5.2: Character Progression Tracking

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** D&D player,  
**I want** comprehensive progression tracking and version snapshots,  
**so that** I can see my character's growth and reference previous states

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Level progression tracking shows complete advancement history
2. Version snapshots are created at each level for audit purposes
3. Snapshots are read-only and easily accessible
4. System tracks all character changes including multiclass progression
5. Progression history includes level-up choices and feature selections
6. Snapshots preserve complete character state for each level
7. System supports character comparison between different levels
8. Progression data integrates with export and AI systems

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement progression tracking system (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create progression history data model
  - [ ] Implement level-up change tracking
  - [ ] Add multiclass progression monitoring
  - [ ] Create progression timeline visualization
- [ ] Build version snapshot system (AC: 2, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Implement automatic snapshot creation at level-up
  - [ ] Create snapshot storage and retrieval system
  - [ ] Add snapshot metadata and timestamps
  - [ ] Implement snapshot comparison functionality
- [ ] Create progression interface (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Build progression history viewer
  - [ ] Implement level comparison interface
  - [ ] Add progression analytics and insights
- [ ] Integrate with other systems (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Connect progression tracking to export system
  - [ ] Integrate with AI assistant for progression insights
  - [ ] Add progression data to character management

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Progression tracking integrates with level-up system and character data model
- Snapshots preserve complete character state including all features and choices
- System must handle multiclass progression and complex character builds
- Integration with export system for progression history sharing

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for progression logic, integration tests for snapshots
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Progression accuracy, snapshot integrity, performance testing

**Architecture Notes:**
- Progression system should be efficient for characters with many levels
- Snapshots must be immutable and tamper-proof
- Performance should support quick access to progression history
- Integration with AI system for intelligent progression insights
