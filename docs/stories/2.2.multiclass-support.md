# Story 2.2: Multiclass Support

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** experienced D&D player,  
**I want** multiclass support with ruleset-dependent validation,  
**so that** I can create complex character builds

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System supports multiclass character creation and progression
2. Multiclass validation follows D&D 5e rules and restrictions
3. User can select multiple classes during character creation
4. System calculates and displays multiclass spellcasting progression
5. Multiclass requirements and restrictions are clearly communicated
6. Character sheet properly displays multiclass information
7. Level-up system handles multiclass progression correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design multiclass data model and validation rules (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Define multiclass character data structure
  - [ ] Implement D&D 5e multiclass validation rules
  - [ ] Create multiclass requirement checking system
- [ ] Implement multiclass character creation interface (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Add multiclass selection to character creation wizard
  - [ ] Create multiclass requirement display and validation
  - [ ] Implement multiclass progression tracking
- [ ] Build multiclass spellcasting system (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Calculate multiclass spellcasting progression
  - [ ] Implement spell slot calculation for multiclass characters
  - [ ] Add spell preparation rules for multiclass spellcasters
- [ ] Integrate multiclass with level-up system (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Update level-up logic for multiclass progression
  - [ ] Handle multiclass feature selection and progression
  - [ ] Implement multiclass experience point tracking

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Multiclass support must integrate with ruleset validation system
- Character data model supports multiple class levels and features
- Spellcasting system handles multiclass progression calculations
- Level-up system tracks multiclass advancement separately

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for multiclass validation, integration tests for progression
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Multiclass validation, spellcasting progression, level-up scenarios

**Architecture Notes:**
- Multiclass system must be ruleset-agnostic for future game system support
- Validation should prevent invalid multiclass combinations
- Character sheet must clearly display multiclass information
- Performance should maintain < 2 minutes for level-up process
