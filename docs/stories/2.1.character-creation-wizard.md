# Story 2.1: Character Creation Wizard

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** new D&D player,  
**I want** a step-by-step character creation wizard,  
**so that** I can create my first character without confusion

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Character creation wizard follows flow: Concept → Abilities → Race → Class → Background → Proficiencies → Equipment → Spells → Review
2. Each step validates previous selections and prevents rule violations
3. User can navigate back to previous steps with data preservation
4. Progress indicator shows completion status for each step
5. Wizard prevents progression until current step is valid
6. Clear explanations and tooltips guide user through each choice
7. Character creation can be completed in under 5 minutes for new players

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design wizard step flow and navigation (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create wizard step components for each creation phase
  - [ ] Implement step navigation with back/forward controls
  - [ ] Add progress indicator showing completion status
- [ ] Implement step validation and rule enforcement (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create validation service for each step
  - [ ] Implement rule checking against active ruleset
  - [ ] Add error messages and guidance for invalid choices
- [ ] Build step content and user interface (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Create forms for each creation step
  - [ ] Add tooltips and help text for user guidance
  - [ ] Implement responsive design for optimal user experience
- [ ] Add step completion tracking and data persistence (AC: 3, 7)
  - [ ] Implement step data storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Add auto-save functionality between steps
  - [ ] Create character data model for wizard state

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Wizard follows D&D 5e character creation flow
- Each step must integrate with ruleset validation system
- Character data model supports all creation phases
- Integration with auto-save system from Epic 1

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for each step, integration tests for wizard flow
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Step validation, navigation, data persistence, performance testing

**Architecture Notes:**
- Wizard must integrate with ruleset system for validation
- Step data should be stored in character model format
- Navigation should preserve user progress and selections
- Performance target: < 5 minutes for complete character creation
