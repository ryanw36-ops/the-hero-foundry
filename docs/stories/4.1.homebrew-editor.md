# Story 4.1: Homebrew Content Editor

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** homebrew content creator,  
**I want** form-based editors with JSON side-by-side view,  
**so that** I can easily create custom races, classes, and items

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Form-based editor with JSON side-by-side view for advanced properties
2. User can choose what type of content to create (race, class, item, spell)
3. Live validation against ruleset schemas with clear error messages
4. Form fields adapt based on content type selection
5. JSON editor allows direct manipulation of advanced properties
6. Editor saves work automatically to prevent data loss
7. One-click export to homebrew directory with proper metadata
8. Editor integrates with ruleset validation system

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Homebrew editor integrates with ruleset validation system
- Content types include races, classes, items, and spells
- JSON schema validation ensures content compliance
- Export system creates shareable homebrew files

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for editor components, integration tests for validation
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Form validation, JSON editing, export functionality

**Architecture Notes:**
- Editor must support all content types defined in ruleset schemas
- Form generation should be dynamic based on content type
- JSON editor should provide real-time validation feedback
- Integration with balance checking system for content validation
