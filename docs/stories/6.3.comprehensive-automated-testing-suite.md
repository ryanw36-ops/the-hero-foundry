# Story 6.3: Comprehensive Automated Testing Suite Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,  
**I want** a comprehensive automated testing suite that covers all critical functionality,  
**so that** we can maintain code quality and prevent regressions as we scale

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests cover all core business logic and utilities
2. Component tests validate React component behavior and rendering
3. Integration tests verify component interactions and data flow
4. End-to-end tests cover critical user workflows
5. Test coverage exceeds 90% for critical code paths
6. Automated test execution on every commit and pull request
7. Test results are clearly reported and actionable

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up Jest testing framework with React Testing Library (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting and thresholds (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all utility functions and business logic (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create component tests for all React components (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for component interactions (AC: 3)
- [ ] Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create E2E tests for critical user workflows (AC: 4)
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing (AC: 6)
- [ ] Set up test result reporting and notifications (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create testing guidelines and best practices documentation (AC: 7)
- [ ] Implement test data factories and fixtures (AC: 1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Add performance testing to the test suite (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Essential for maintaining code quality
- **Current State:** Limited testing infrastructure
- **Target State:** Comprehensive testing with 90%+ coverage
- **Testing Stack:** Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing on every commit
- **Coverage Goals:** 90%+ for critical business logic

## Testing
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test coverage meets 90% threshold
- [ ] Tests run automatically on code changes
- [ ] Test results are clearly reported
- [ ] Performance tests validate performance targets
- [ ] No false positives or flaky tests

## Change Log
