# Story 3.2: Rule Explanations & AI Assistance

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player learning D&D,  
**I want** AI-powered rule explanations and recommendations,  
**so that** I can understand why certain choices matter

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI provides clear, accurate explanations of D&D rules and mechanics
2. Rule citations are provided when possible for verification
3. AI considers character build context across conversations
4. AI recommends optimal choices based on character concept and goals
5. AI validates character builds against D&D rules
6. Safety rails prevent AI from suggesting rule violations in Balanced Mode
7. AI can explain complex mechanics like multiclassing and spellcasting
8. Fallback mechanisms work when AI is unavailable

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement rule explanation engine (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create rule knowledge base integration
  - [ ] Implement citation system for rule references
  - [ ] Build explanation formatting and display
- [ ] Develop context-aware AI assistance (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create character build context analysis
  - [ ] Implement recommendation engine for choices
  - [ ] Add goal-based optimization suggestions
- [ ] Build character validation system (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create rule validation engine
  - [ ] Implement safety rail system for Balanced Mode
  - [ ] Add validation feedback and suggestions
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Create offline rule lookup system
  - [ ] Implement cached response system
  - [ ] Add graceful degradation when AI unavailable

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- AI system integrates with ruleset validation for accurate rule checking
- Context system gathers character build information for personalized assistance
- Safety rails ensure AI doesn't suggest rule violations in Balanced Mode
- Fallback system provides offline rule assistance when AI unavailable

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for AI logic, integration tests for rule validation
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Rule accuracy, context awareness, safety rail testing

**Architecture Notes:**
- AI system must maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
- Rule validation should be real-time and accurate
- Performance should not impact character creation workflow
- Integration with balance checking and validation tools
