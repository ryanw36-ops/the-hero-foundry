# Story 5.1: Character Export System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player or Game Master,  
**I want** multiple export formats with professional templates,  
**so that** I can share or print my character sheets

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PDF export generates classic D&D character sheet appearance
2. PNG export creates high-quality rendered character images
3. JSON export provides complete character data for external tools
4. Template-driven exports use ruleset-specific formatting
5. Automatic SRD attribution and licensing information included
6. Export clearly indicates if character is Balanced or Free-for-All mode
7. Export system handles all character types including multiclass
8. Export quality meets professional standards

  - [ ] Implement SRD attribution system
  - [ ] Add mode flagging for Balanced vs Free-for-All
  - [ ] Create export metadata generation
  - [ ] Add licensing information display

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Export system integrates with character data model and ruleset system
- Templates must support all character types including multiclass
- Export formats include PDF, PNG, and JSON for maximum compatibility
- Professional quality required for character sheet appearance

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for export services, integration tests for format generation
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- Specific testing requirements: Export quality, format validation, template rendering

**Architecture Notes:**
- Export system should be asynchronous to handle large character data
- Templates must be easily customizable for different rulesets
- Export quality should meet professional printing standards
- Performance should support multiple concurrent exports
