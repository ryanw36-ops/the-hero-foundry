## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** new D&D player,  
**I want** to easily select my character's race, class, and background,  
**so that** I can create a character that matches my vision

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Race selection shows all available races with descriptions and traits
2. Class selection displays class features, hit dice, and saving throw proficiencies
3. Background selection includes skill proficiencies and feature descriptions
4. Selections update character sheet in real-time
5. System prevents invalid race/class combinations
6. Racial traits and class features are clearly explained
7. Background features integrate with character creation flow
8. Selections can be changed before finalizing character

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Race, class, and background data comes from ruleset system
- Selections affect many character calculations and features
- System must support homebrew content integration
- Validation prevents rule-breaking character combinations

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for selection logic, integration tests for updates
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Selection validation, real-time updates, error handling

**Architecture Notes:**
- Selection system must integrate with ruleset validation
- Real-time updates should be performant and responsive
- Interface should support both new and experienced players
- System must handle complex interdependencies between selections
