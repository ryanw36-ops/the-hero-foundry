# Story 1.3: File-Based Storage System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a file-based storage system for local data management,  
**so that** all data is stored locally without cloud dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Default project root is set to user documents folder
2. File system operations work reliably for local storage
3. Automatic saving occurs at each step with draft recovery
4. Character snapshots are created at each level for version tracking
5. Export/import functionality works for data portability
6. System handles file corruption gracefully with backup recovery
7. Storage operations are optimized for performance and reliability

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design file storage directory structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Define project root location and subdirectories
  - [ ] Create storage service for file operations
  - [ ] Implement cross-platform path handling
- [ ] Implement automatic saving and recovery system (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create auto-save service with configurable intervals
  - [ ] Implement draft recovery for interrupted sessions
  - [ ] Add version snapshot creation for character progression
- [ ] Build export/import functionality (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create data export service with multiple formats
  - [ ] Implement import validation and conflict resolution
  - [ ] Add backup creation before import operations
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery mechanisms (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Implement file corruption detection
  - [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring for storage operations

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- Local-first storage with no cloud synchronization
- Default project root in user documents folder
- File-based architecture with JSON storage for all data
- Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux file systems

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Unit tests for storage operations, integration tests for file handling
- Testing frameworks: Jest for frontend, pytest for backend
- Specific testing requirements: Cross-platform file operations, corruption recovery, performance testing

**Architecture Notes:**
- Storage system must work offline with no internet dependencies
- File operations should be atomic to prevent data corruption
- Backup system should create automatic snapshots of critical data
- Performance should support 100+ concurrent character creation sessions
