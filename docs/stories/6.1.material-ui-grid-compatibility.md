# Story 6.1: Material-UI Grid Compatibility Issues Resolution

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** all Material-UI Grid components to work properly across the application,  
**so that** we have consistent, responsive layouts without TypeScript errors

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All Grid component usage follows Material-UI v7 standards
2. No TypeScript errors related to Grid components
3. Responsive behavior maintained across all screen sizes
4. Consistent layout patterns throughout the application
5. All Grid-related code follows established patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Audit all Grid component usage across the project (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Identify files with Grid compatibility issues (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Update Grid imports to use proper Material-UI v7 approach (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Replace problematic Grid usage with Box + CSS Grid or proper Grid2 (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on all screen sizes (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create Grid usage guidelines and patterns (AC: 4, 5)
- [ ] Update component library documentation (AC: 5)
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - This affects development velocity and code quality
- **Known Issues:** Grid component breaking changes in Material-UI v7
- **Solution Options:** 
  - Use Box with CSS Grid (recommended)
  - Use Grid2 component if available
  - Fallback to Flexbox layouts
- **Files to Check:** All React components using Grid
- **Testing:** Verify responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Testing
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All layouts render correctly on different screen sizes
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints work as expected
- [ ] No visual regressions in existing layouts
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Change Log
- **Created:** 2025-01-27 - Critical Grid compatibility issues identified by QA
