# Archon Migration Summary

## What Was Changed

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate from custom MCP servers to the official Archon setup as recommended by the creators.

## Files Removed

The following custom MCP server files were removed as they don't follow the official Archon architecture:

- `archon-mcp.py` - Custom MCP server implementation
- `archon-mcp-simple.py` - Simplified custom MCP server
- `archon-mcp-working.py` - Another custom MCP variant
- `archon-tcp-server.py` - TCP-based custom server
- `http-mcp-server.py` - HTTP-based custom server
- `http-mcp-server-fixed.py` - Fixed HTTP server variant
- `proper-mcp-server.py` - Another custom implementation
- `simple-mcp-server.py` - Simple custom server
- `mcp-server.py` - Generic MCP server
- `docker-compose.hero-foundry.yml` - Custom Docker setup

## Files Added

The following files were added to implement the official Archon setup:

### Core Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Official Archon Docker Compose configuration
- `archon.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `ARCHON_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

### Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-archon.sh` - Linux/macOS setup script
- `scripts/setup-archon.ps1` - Windows PowerShell setup script
- `start-archon.ps1` - Quick start script for Windows

### Testing
- `test-archon-connection.py` - Connection test script

## Why These Changes Were Made

### 1. **Official Architecture Compliance**
The custom MCP servers were single-purpose implementations that didn't provide the full Archon ecosystem. The official setup includes:
- **Frontend UI** (React + Vite) on port 3737
- **API Server** (FastAPI + SocketIO) on port 8181
- **MCP Server** (Lightweight HTTP wrapper) on port 8051
- **Agents Service** (PydanticAI) on port 8052
- **Database** (PostgreSQL + PGVector)
- **Cache** (Redis)

### 2. **Proper Microservices Architecture**
The official setup follows true microservices principles:
- Each service is independent and containerized
- Clear separation of concerns
- No shared code dependencies
- Independent scaling capabilities

### 3. **Full Feature Set**
The official Archon provides:
- **Knowledge Management**: Web crawling, document processing, vector search
- **AI Integration**: 10 MCP tools for comprehensive functionality
- **Project Management**: Hierarchical projects with AI assistance
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket updates and multi-user support

### 4. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
The official MCP server:
- Follows the Model Context Protocol specification
- Provides 10 standardized tools
- Integrates seamlessly with Cursor IDE
- Supports multiple AI model providers

## Benefits of the New Setup

### 1. **Better Integration**
- Seamless Cursor IDE integration
- Standardized MCP tools
- Professional-grade architecture

### 2. **Enhanced Functionality**
- Full knowledge base management
- AI-assisted project creation
- Advanced document processing
- Real-time collaboration features

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Official support and updates
- Community-driven development
- Well-documented architecture
- Standard deployment practices

### 4. **Scalability**
- Independent service scaling
- Load balancing capabilities
- Production-ready configuration
- Enterprise-grade features

## Migration Process

### 1. **Setup Phase**
```powershell
# Run the setup script
.\scripts\setup-archon.ps1
```

### 2. **Configuration Phase**
- Copy `archon.env.example` to `.env`
- Add your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
- Customize ports if needed

### 3. **Startup Phase**
```powershell
# Quick start
.\start-archon.ps1

# Or manual start
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. **Integration Phase**
- Open Archon UI: http://localhost:3737
- Complete initial setup
- Get MCP connection details
- Configure Cursor IDE

### 5. **Testing Phase**
```bash
python test-archon-connection.py
```

## Current Status

âœ… **Migration Complete**
- All custom MCP servers removed
- Official Archon setup implemented
- Proper Docker configuration in place
- Setup scripts created for all platforms
- Comprehensive documentation provided

## Next Steps

1. **Run Setup**: Execute the appropriate setup script for your platform
2. **Configure Environment**: Set up your `.env` file with API keys
3. **Start Services**: Use `start-archon.ps1` or `docker-compose up -d`
4. **Test Connection**: Run `python test-archon-connection.py`
5. **Integrate with Cursor**: Configure MCP connection in Cursor IDE
6. **Start Using**: Begin using Archon's full feature set

## Support

- **Setup Guide**: See `ARCHON_SETUP.md`
- **Official Docs**: [Archon GitHub](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon)
- **Issues**: Check container logs with `docker-compose logs`
- **Reset**: Use `docker-compose down -v` to start fresh

---

**Note**: This migration brings your setup in line with the official Archon recommendations, providing a professional-grade knowledge management and AI integration platform that will significantly enhance your development workflow with Cursor IDE.
